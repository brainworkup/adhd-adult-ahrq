## Project Title: Diagnosis of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder in Adults: A Systematic Review
Initial Publication Date: August 2024

### I. Background and Objectives for the Systematic Review

Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is characterized by persistent symptoms in the domains of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity [1]. Despite the established diagnostic criteria in the DSM-5, diagnosing ADHD in adults remains challenging due to the frequent lack of hyperactivity and impulsivity symptoms, the subtlety of inattention symptoms, and the overlap with other mental health conditions [22, 23, 24]. Furthermore, the accurate diagnosis of adult ADHD is complicated by the growing number of individuals seeking stimulant medications to improve cognitive performance [25, 26-30]. The lack of a "gold-standard" diagnosis and the variability in diagnostic performance among clinicians and settings add to the complexity [31-33, 34].

The diagnosis of ADHD in adults is often made by primary care physicians (PCPs) rather than specialists, highlighting the need for effective diagnostic tools and guidelines [42]. Currently, there are no guidelines in the US, and the Australian guidelines may not be applicable to the US context. The existing standards and guidelines for diagnosing ADHD in adults are limited, and the use of diagnostic tools and assessments varies widely in practice [36-38].

#### Purpose of the Review
This systematic review aims to provide a comprehensive and unbiased assessment of the diagnostic tools and assessments used to diagnose ADHD among adults, with a focus on their accuracy, reliability, and feasibility in primary care settings. The review will explore the contextual factors that influence diagnostic decisions, including the lack of guidelines, variability in clinical practice, and uncertainty about disease diagnosis. The importance of accurate diagnosis cannot be overstated, as it directly affects the management and treatment of ADHD, as well as the prevention of misdiagnosis and misuse of medications.

The DSM-5 criteria, developed primarily for children, may not be suitable for adult diagnosis, and the requirement of symptoms beginning before age 12 has been debated [8-10, 41, 42]. Furthermore, the diagnostic accuracy of tools and assessments used in adult ADHD diagnosis is unclear, and their performance may vary depending on the characteristics of the ADHD participants and comparator samples [39, 40].

The key research questions guiding this review are:

* What is the comparative diagnostic accuracy of tools used to diagnose ADHD among adults?
* What are the adverse events associated with the use of these tools?
* How do the performance characteristics of these tools vary depending on the characteristics of the ADHD participants and comparator samples?
* What are the contextual factors that influence diagnostic decisions in primary care settings?

By addressing these research questions, this systematic review will provide critical evidence to inform the development of guidelines, clinical practice, and policy decisions related to the diagnosis and management of ADHD in adults.
