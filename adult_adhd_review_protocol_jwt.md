## Project Title: Diagnosis of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder in Adults: A Systematic Review
Initial Publication Date: August 2024

### I. Background and Objectives for the Systematic Review

Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is characterized by persistent symptoms in the domains of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. DSM-5 requires symptoms begin before the age of 12, are present in two or more settings, interfere with social, academic, or occupational functioning, and cannot be better explained by the presence of another disorder with overlapping symptoms. Recent longitudinal studies suggest that ADHD does not always necessarily begin in childhood;8-10 epidemiological studies not requiring childhood onset suggest a prevalence of ADHD in adults as high as 6.7%.11-14

There are several dilemmas pertaining to the diagnosis of ADHD in adults. ADHD is most often first diagnosed in elementary or middle school age years or, less commonly, in high school or college when having trouble meeting academic demands. It can also be first diagnosed in adulthood, when impairments in attention, organization, and impulsivity produce recurrent problems with occupational, social, or family functioning. Adult diagnosis is often difficult because the outward manifestations most readily evident to others, hyperactivity and impulsivity, often improve during adolescence and many adults no longer meet diagnostic criteria when strictly applied.22 The symptoms of inattention (e.g., easy distractibility, poor organization, being “spacey,” avoiding and trouble completing tasks that require sustained attention, losing things, forgetfulness) are more subtle and may not reach the level of obvious functional impairment until adulthood, for example within an occupational setting or a marriage.

The diagnosis of ADHD in adults, as in childhood, is complicated by the overlap of symptoms with other disorders.23, 24 Attention and concentration, for example, can be impaired in persons who have depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety, psychosis, post-traumatic stress disorder, or substance abuse. Hyperactivity can be confused with anxiety-related behaviors and the excessive movements of tic and obsessive-compulsive disorders. Impulsivity if often prominent in bipolar and substance use disorders. The accurate diagnosis of adult ADHD is further complicated by a substantial and growing number of individuals, especially college students25 and highly driven working professionals, who seek stimulant medications to aid cognitive performance. Stimulants have long been known to improve sustained attention and reduce distractibility in healthy individuals who do not have ADHD,26-30 prompting some success-oriented individuals to feign symptoms to their doctors or on neuropsychological test assessments.

These diagnostic challenges can complicate the accurate and reliable diagnosis of adult ADHD even for experienced mental health clinicians. Research-grade diagnoses aided by the use of structured diagnostic interviews conducted by trained clinicians are more reliable, but nevertheless imperfect,31-33 making elusive a “gold-standard” diagnosis by which to compare the diagnostic performance in other settings and using other diagnostic aids. An accurate diagnosis is essential if patients who need care for ADHD receive it and those who need different care for a diagnosis with overlapping symptoms receive it, and to prevent misuse and diversion.34 The key decisional dilemmas for diagnosis include whether a patient should be evaluated by a clinician highly experienced in ADHD diagnosis, whether that assessment should be supported by a structured diagnostic interview, whether the diagnosis can be made by less experienced clinicians with or without the use of diagnostic aids (e.g., generalist primary care physicians and psychiatric nurse practitioners), and whether diagnosis should also include the experience and skill required to differentiate ADHD from potentially confounding diagnoses.35

There are also controversies and challenges in the topic area and evidence base. As detailed above, diagnosing ADHD in adults is challenging due to the frequent paucity and/or more nuanced expression of hyperactivity and impulsivity symptoms, the difficulty in appreciating and assessing the symptoms of inattention, the overlap of ADHD symptoms with those of other mental health problems, the feigning of symptoms by those seeking stimulants for other purposes, and the challenges in confirming a childhood onset of symptoms. A paucity of information on the experience and skill needed to diagnose ADHD accurately and to discriminate it from other illnesses, as well as by the dearth of information on the utility of diagnostic tools, are additional challenges.36-38 Claims of exceptional diagnostic performance of these tools, the differing psychometric measures of performance, and the differing performance characteristics of different versions of a given tool,39 are controversial and often confusing to clinicians, patients, and other stakeholders. Whether the performance of diagnostic tools varies with the characteristics of the ADHD participants or comparator sample is unknown.40
The challenges with diagnosis therefore contribute to controversy over the extent to which ADHD is over- or under-diagnosed in adult populations.22 Also increasingly controversial is whether the DSM-5 requirement that ADHD symptoms begin before age 12 is appropriate, and whether the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for ADHD, which were developed primarily for children,8-10, 41 are appropriate for diagnosis of adults.42 

### Purpose of the Review
This systematic review will assess the comparative diagnostic accuracy and adverse events of tools used to diagnose ADHD among adults. The intended audience includes policymakers and clinicians.
